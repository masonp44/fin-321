## 1. Problem Statement

Our company has a €8,000,000 receivable due in one year from a European client, creating foreign exchange exposure to fluctuations in the EUR/USD rate. Since our functional currency is the U.S. dollar, any depreciation of the euro would reduce the USD value of the payment and negatively affect reported revenues and profit margins.

The objective of this analysis is to protect the U.S. dollar value of the future euro-denominated inflow while balancing cost, flexibility, and potential upside if the euro appreciates. This issue falls under the purview of corporate treasury, which is responsible for managing currency risk across international operations.

Accordingly, this specification establishes a framework to quantify, compare, and evaluate three hedging alternatives—forward contracts, money market hedges, and option-based hedges—to determine the most effective strategy for mitigating exchange rate risk and ensuring predictable USD cash flows.

## 2. Inputs (Known Variables)

Create a clean, professional input table. This will become the foundation for your spreadsheet and future AI prompts.

| Variable | Description | Unit | Example | Source |
|-----------|-------------|------|----------|--------|
| `FC_AMT` | Foreign-currency receivable | EUR | 8,000,000 | Company data |
| `S₀` | Current EURUSD spot rate | EUR/USD | 1.16 | Market data |
| `F₀` | 1-year EURUSD forward rate | EUR/USD | 1.0890 | Provided |
| `r_USD` | USD 1-year interest rate | % | 3.55 | Market data |
| `r_EUR` | EUR 1-year interest rate | % | 2.15 | Market data |
| `t` | Time to maturity | Years | 1 | Derived |
| `K_put` | EUR Put strike | EUR/USD | 1.16 | Analyst choice |
| `K_call` | EUR Call strike | EUR/USD | 1.16 | Analyst choice |
| `Premium_put` | Put premium | USD per contract | 0.021 | Scenario |
| `Premium_call` | Call premium | USD per contract | 0.026 | Scenario |

> *Tip:* Keep labels short and standardized. Think like a financial modeler — these names should become variable names, spreadsheet inputs, or prompt parameters later.
