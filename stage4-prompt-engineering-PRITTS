You are a financial modeling assistant with advanced Excel generation capabilities.

# GOAL
Create a professional Excel spreadsheet that models forward, money market, and option hedges for a EUR receivable.

# CONTEXT FILES (GitHub)
Use the logic and structure in the following files as the modeling standard:
- https://github.com/masonp44/fin-321/blob/main/template-memo.md
- https://github.com/masonp44/fin-321/blob/main/stage2-spec-PRITTS.md

# INPUT VARIABLES (Explicit Values)
Use the following exact values in the spreadsheet:

FC_AMT = 2,850,000            ⟹ Named Range: FC_AMT
Spot rate at execution (S0_in) = 1.0934          ⟹ Named Range: S0_in
Forward rate offered (F0_in) = 1.0875           ⟹ Named Range: F0_in
USD interest rate (annual) = 5.10%               ⟹ Named Range: R_USD
EUR interest rate (annual) = 2.71%               ⟹ Named Range: R_FC
Put strike price = 1.0900                        ⟹ Named Range: K_PUT
Call strike price = 1.0900                       ⟹ Named Range: K_CALL
Put premium = 0.017                              ⟹ Named Range: PREM_PUT
Call premium = 0.022                             ⟹ Named Range: PREM_CALL
Time to maturity in days = 360                   ⟹ Named Range: T_DAYS

# MARKET LOOKUPS (Assumptions to be hard-coded)
- Spot rate used for sensitivity table must match S0_in
- Use the given spot; no additional API calls assumed

# NAMED RANGES REQUIRED
Define the following named ranges exactly:
FC_AMT, S0_in, F0_in, R_USD, R_FC,
K_PUT, K_CALL, PREM_PUT, PREM_CALL,
T_DAYS, T_YRS

# COLOR CODING RULES
Apply the following fill colors in Excel:
- Yellow = Inputs / decision variables (S0_in, F0_in, FC_AMT, K_PUT, K_CALL, PREM_PUT, PREM_CALL)
- Blue = Assumptions (R_USD, R_FC, T_DAYS, T_YRS)
- Green = All formulas / calculations
- Gray = Final outputs / KPIs

# CALCULATIONS REQUIRED

## A. Time Conversion
- T_YRS = T_DAYS / 360

## B. Forward Hedge
1. Calculate USD cash inflow if hedged forward:
   = FC_AMT × F0_in
2. Report revenue in USD under forward hedge

## C. Money Market Hedge (Three-Step Logic)
1. Discount EUR receivable:
   EUR present value = FC_AMT / (1 + R_FC × T_YRS)
2. Convert to USD at spot:
   USD value = EUR present value × S0_in
3. Invest USD at USD rate:
   USD hedge proceeds = USD value × (1 + R_USD × T_YRS)

## D. Option Hedge
1. Cost of setting up the option positions:
   Total premium cost = FC_AMT × PREM_PUT + FC_AMT × PREM_CALL
2. Option payoff formulas:
   - Put payoff = MAX(K_PUT − Spot scenario, 0) × FC_AMT
   - Call payoff = MAX(Spot scenario − K_CALL, 0) × FC_AMT
3. Net USD outcome with options = (Option payoff − Premium cost)

## E. Sensitivity Analysis
Build a table for Spot from 0.95×S0_in to 1.05×S0_in at uniform steps (e.g., 5 or 11 points):
- Column A: Spot scenario
- Column B: Forward USD outcome
- Column C: Money Market USD outcome
- Column D: Option USD outcome
- Highlight formulas in GREEN

## F. Clean Output Section (Gray)
Report:
- Forward hedge value (USD)
- Money market hedge value (USD)
- Option hedge value (USD)
- Sensitivity summary: Best hedge per scenario

# FORMATTING & LABELS
- Insert labeled sections: Inputs, Assumptions, Calculations, Sensitivity Results, KPIs
- Freeze top row
- Auto-fit columns
- Use consistent number formatting: 2 decimals for rates, currency for USD/EUR

# VERIFICATION & CROSS-CHECKS
Include a verification section that:
1. Validates parity:
   - Check if Forward hedge ≈ Money Market hedge within a tolerance (show difference)
2. Confirms that **all named ranges exist** and are referenced in formulas
3. Exports a table listing every named range and its address
4. Returns a **full formula mapping**: each cell’s direct formula (not just value)

# OUTPUT
- Generate a downloadable Excel file named: `Hedge_Model_EUR_Receivable.xlsx`
- All wand color coding, named ranges, and sections must be present
- Provide a sheet named “Documentation” summarizing how each calculation was implemented

# FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
Return only the downloadable `.xlsx` file — no additional text description.
